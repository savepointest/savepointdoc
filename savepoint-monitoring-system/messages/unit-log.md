# Unit Log

Any manipulations with the unit properties or its database are logged in the system automatically. In addition, records can be added to the unit log manually — through the [event registrar](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/reg). To see the unit log or add messages to it, you should have not only the _Query reports or messages_ [access](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/rights/unit) but also _Manage log_.

Any changes in the [Unit Properties dialog](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/units/units#unit_properties_dialog) are logged, as well as import, export, and removal of messages, assignment or reset of a driver. etc.

The log contains the following information:

* **Time** — the date and time when the change was done.
* **User** — the name of the user who entered the record or changes.
* **Action** — the description of the change performed. Messages can be [filtered](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/msg/manage#messages_filter) by the text in this description.
* **Host** — the address of the computer from which the user made the changes \(if the action was performed automatically, it can be a _job_ or _notification_ type entry\).
* **Delete** — the button to delete records.
