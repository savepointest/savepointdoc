# SMS Messages

SMS messages can be sent by a unit while executing a command, generating an alarm or in other cases, which depend on the device type. The table generated for this request consists of three columns: the time when the message was received, the text of the message and the SIM card number embedded into the unit. Messages can be [filtered](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/msg/manage#messages_filter) by text.
