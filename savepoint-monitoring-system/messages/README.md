# Messages

The _Messages_ panel gives access to the [units](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/units/units) database. Here you can view all messages received from units \(coordinates, parameters, speed, etc.\), as well as SMS messages received from them, commands sent to units and events registered in units history. Besides, this data can be [exported](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/msg/port) to a number of formats.

To open the _Messages_ panel, select a corresponding name in the [top panel](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/top) or click on the necessary item in the [main menu customizer](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/left#main_menu_adjustment_and_navigation). The workspace of the panel can be divided into four sections:

* in the left top corner you can set the parameters of your request;
* in the bottom left part there is the statistics for current request or a panel to export/import messages;
* in the top right section there is the map;
* at the lower right section there are messages themselves.

The sectors can be resized \(the left ones — in width, the right ones — both in width and height\). To do this, click on the border between them with the left mouse button and while holding it, move the border to the right/left or up/down. At the same time, if less than 10% of the map is left while expanding the lower sector, the map automatically collapses. To return it, press on the line under the [top panel](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/top).
