# Sent Commands

The commands sent to the unit by users are displayed on the _Sent Commands_ request. There is a special button in the monitoring panel to [send commands](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/cmd) to units. The table includes:

* **Time** — the time when the command was sent to the unit.
* **User** — the login name of the [user](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/users/users) who performed the command. If there is a dash in this cell, it means you have no [access](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/rights/rights) to this user, that is why the login name is hidden.
* **Command name** — the command name as it is written in the unit properties.
* **Command type** — the command type \(see the [list](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/cmd#standard_commands)\).
* **Parameters** — for the commands that require additional parameters \(message to the driver, input activation/deactivation, report period, custom message, etc.\).
* **Execution time** — the time when the command was executed. If the execution failed due to billing limitations \(e.g., you ran out of SMS messages\), this column contains only dashes.
* **Channel** — the type of connection used to transmit the command \(_TCP_, _UDP_, _Virtual_, _SMS_\).
