# Registered Events

Different types of events can be registered in the unit history automatically or manually.

Automatic registration is adjusted with the help of [notifications](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/notify/notify) \(delivery method must be _Register event for unit_, _Register as violation_ or _Register unit status_. In such a manner, you can control geofence visits, connection loss, idling, service intervals, etc.

Manually an event can be registered in the special [registrar](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/reg) in the monitoring panel. With this method, you can register fuel fillings, maintenance, unit statuses, and any custom event.

[Traffic counter reset](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/units/counters) and [routes statuses](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/routes/routes) can be saved as events.

In the table you see:

* the time when the event was detected \(automatic registration\) or registered \(manual registration\);
* type: event \(traffic counter reset, events from notifications, some custom events, route control statuses\), violation \(violations from notifications, some custom events\), maintenance \(registered manually\);
* event text which is taken from the text of a notification or from the description entered while registering manually.
