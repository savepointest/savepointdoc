![:!:](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/lib/images/smileys/icon_exclaim.gif) _Note._  
User settings can be changed if the corresponding checkbox has been marked in the [user properties](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/users/props#general) dialog.

To view user settings click on the username in the [top panel](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/top) and then choose _User Settings_ in the menu.

The _User Settings_ dialog can contain up to five tabs, depending on the system configuration:

* [General Settings](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/general)
* [Security](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/security)
* [Maps](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/maps)
* [Account](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/account)
* [Notifications](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/notifications)

The settings of one user can be imported to other users. [Here](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/port/set) you can learn more about the transfer of user settings.
