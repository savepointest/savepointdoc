# Unit Additional Information

Additional information includes the following items: last message, location, presence in geofences, distance to the geofence \(if the [_Distance from unit to geofence_](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/general#general_settings) option is activated\), speed, altitude, coordinates, counters, satellites, connectivity settings, icon, sensor values, parameters, drivers, trailers, custom fields, and maintenance intervals.

Additional information can be found in the tooltip of a unit, as well as in the extended unit information of the monitoring panel work list.

### Unit's Tooltip <a id="unit_s_tooltip"></a>

A tooltip to a unit is displayed when you hover the mouse pointer over a unit on the map, in the worklist, in any dialogs, and so on. You can copy the information from the tooltip by selecting and saving the necessary fragment to the clipboard. The content for this tooltip is selected in the [_User Settings_](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/general#show_additional_information_about_the_unit).

For example, the tooltip may look like this:

The characteristics are displayed in the tooltip in the same order they go in the [_Profile_](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/units/charact) tab of the unit properties.

### Extended Unit Information <a id="extended_unit_information"></a>

Apart from that, additional information about the unit can be obtained by clicking on the unit icon in the working list of the dashboard \(in both modes\). Click on the unit's icon in the Monitoring panel to see the extended information. The content of the extended unit view is also adjusted in the [User Settings](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/set/general#show_additional_information_about_the_unit).

You can apply the extended view to any number of units in the work list. To hide the extended information, click on the unit icon again.

![:!:](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/lib/images/smileys/icon_exclaim.gif) _Note_.  
The values indicated in the pop-up window as well as in the expanded display, depending on the unit settings, can be presented in the metric system of measures \(kilometers, meters, kilometers per hour, liters\), American \(miles, feet, miles per hour, gallons\) or imperial \(miles, feet, miles per hour, gallons\).

### Monitoring Options Menu <a id="monitoring_options_menu"></a>

To summon the [monitoring options](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/icons) menu, click on a required unit on the map. This menu contains the same functionality that was [selected](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/icons) in the monitoring options. In addition, regardless of the options selected, the menu always contains the buttons for generating a quick report and building a quick track.

The monitoring menu does not contain the unit location icon, tracking option, and clear list button even if they are chosen as the monitoring options.

During a movement of a unit, the menu moves with it and always displays updated information about the unit. To close it, click anywhere outside this menu.
