# Top Panel



In the upper panel on the left there is the logo of the tracking services provider, and on the right, there is the menu setting button and the username under which the user logs on.

The [main menu](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/left) of the program occupies the central part of the top panel. It contains different elements depending on the settings applied and also on the modules provided.
