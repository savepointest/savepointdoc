# Print Report

After generating an online report, you can print it without first exporting it to a file. To do this, press the _Print_ button, which is located above the active table or chart only when there is a generated report in the browser window.

In the left part of the _Print Report_ dialog, you see the list of sections which are included in the report. Check those that you are going to print. On the right, you can preview these tables, charts, map, etc. To start printing, press _Print_. To exit, click _Close_.

In Internet Explorer 10, maps and charts cannot be printed if the _Enhanced Protected Mode_ option is on.
