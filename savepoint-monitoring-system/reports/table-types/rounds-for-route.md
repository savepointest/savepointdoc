# Rounds \(for route\)

If the [route](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/routes/routes) was completed by some units, then on the basis of this data it is possible to build a corresponding report. It can include:

* **Beginning** — the start time of the round \(activation time or entrance in the first checkpoint\).
* **Last activity** — the time of receiving of the latest data concerning this round.
* **Round** — the name of the round.
* **Schedule** — the name of the schedule.
* **Order** — the order of checkpoints.
* **Unit** — the name of the unit that performed the round. If several units are assigned to the round during its creation, dashes are displayed in the report.
* **Status** — _Finished_ \(the route was successfully activated, and the entrance to the last point was subsequently recorded\), _Not finished_ \(the last point was not visited\) or _Aborted_ \(the round has been removed from the table manually or its expiration time has been reached\).
* **Points** — the total number of checkpoints in the route \(a detailed report can be generated — [Check Points](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/tables/points)\).
* **Skipped** — the number of checkpoints skipped.
* **Visited** — the number of checkpoints visited.

The report type should be _Route_.
