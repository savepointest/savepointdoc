# Messages Tracing

The main objective of this report is to facilitate the work with the parameters from the [messages](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/msg/data). That is why the parameter values are presented not as a single data array but have a particular structure. It means that every parameter is located in its own column.

Along with the parameter values, this report can include other columns:

* **Time** — the date and time when the message was sent.
* **Speed** — the speed of a unit from the received message.
* **Coordinates** — the coordinates of the unit.
* **Location** — the location of the unit at the time when the message was sent.
* **Value** — the value of the parameter sent in a message.
* **Driver** — the name of the driver \(if available\).
* **Trailer** — the name of the trailer \(if one was bound\).
* **Notes** — an empty column to add your custom comments after printing or exporting the report.
