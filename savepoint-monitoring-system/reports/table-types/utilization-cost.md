# Utilization Cost

The table on utilization costs unites two kinds of expenses: maintenance and fillings. Both of these features have their own detailed tables \(see [Maintenance](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/tables/maintenance)and [Fuel Fillings](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/tables/fillings)\). This table is designed to show running costs. Note that only fillings registered manually in a special [Events Registrar](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/reg) get here \(fillings detected by a fuel sensor are _not_ considered\).

The table can be composed of the following columns:

* **Time** — the date and time that were indicated during the registration.
* **Registration time** — the date and time when the event was registered.
* **Expense item** — either maintenance or filling.
* **Description** — the custom description specified at registration.
* **Location** — the location specified at registration \(together with comments entered manually\).
* **Cost** — the service or filling cost.
* **Count** — the number of services and/or fillings.
* **Notes** — an empty column for your custom comments.
