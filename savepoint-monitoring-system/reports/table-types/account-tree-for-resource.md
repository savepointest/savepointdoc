# Account Tree \(for resource\)

This report provides you with information about the structure of an account. In other words, the table helps you understand which object types the selected account consists of, as well as the hierarchy among these objects.

The table may contain the following columns:

* **Object type** — accounts, resources, users, units, unit groups, retranslators, routes.
* **Name** — the name of an object.

The type of objects in the report template can be specified. Then only the objects of the selected types are displayed in the report.

In addition, the data are presented more clearly if you group by type of object in the report template.
