# Violations

Violations are a particular case of [events](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/tables/events). The report on violations gives the list of violations detected and registered in the unit history.

Violations can be recorded in two ways:

1. With the help of [notifications](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/notify/notify) if _Register as violation_ is selected as an action;
2. With the help of manually registered [custom events](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/reg) if they have the _Violation_ box checked.

To make a report on a particular kind of violations, enter a mask in the report template to filter the text/description of violations \(such as \*speed\*, \*accident\*, \*temperature\*, etc.\). Only the messages whose text corresponds to the given mask are added to the table.

The following information can be presented in this kind of report:

* **Violation time** — the time when the violation happened.
* **Time received** — the time when the server received the data.
* **Violation text** — the text of the notification or the description of the event.
* **Location** — unit location at the moment of violation.
* **Driver** — the name of the [driver](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/drivers/drivers) \(if identified\).
* **Count** — the number of violations.
* **Notes** — an empty column for your custom comments.

In addition, you can use special [markers](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/templ/settings/map#markers) for this report.
