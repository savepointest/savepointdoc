A template can contain any number of tables and charts. You can even add the same table type several times with different configuration of columns, data grouping, and other settings.

To add any of the tables mentioned above to the template, click the _Add Table_ button and select the table from the list.

Each table type has its own set of columns that can be included in it. After the table type is selected, the list of available columns is displayed below. Check the columns you would like to include in the resulting table. To select all columns at once, press _Ctrl_ and check any box. To deselect all columns, repeat the same operation. This combination works also for the reports where you choose geofences, events, etc.

When the private mode of the trip is detected \(if the unit has the [_Private mode_](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/units/sensors/types#cifrovye) type sensor with the [_Do not show unit location_](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/units/sensors/props) option enabled\), in all the columns related to the location, dashes are displayed.

You can assign other names to column headings. To do this, click on the title and edit the text. In the same way you can change the name of the table itself \(the _Name_ text box at the top of the dialog\). To restore the default column names, use the _Restore default_ button ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/rename.png) \(if it is gray, the current name is default\).

Besides, you can change the order of the columns. Drag the double-arrow sign ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/drag.png) up/down to move them up and down.

Some alternative types of standard reports are available as applications:

* [iDriveSafe](http://apps.wialon.com/?lang=en#idrivesafe) — assessment of the driving behavior;
* [Dashboard](http://apps.wialon.com/?lang=en#dashboard) — graphic presentation of the key performance indicators of your fleet;
* [Driving Logbook](http://apps.wialon.com/?lang=en#drivinglogbook) — a tax report that determines the actual use of the company car for private and/or business purposes \(on the basis of the _Trips_ report\).
