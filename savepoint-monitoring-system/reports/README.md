# Reports

To switch to the _Reports_ panel, click on the _Reports_ header in the [top panel](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/top) and select the same name item in the [main menu customizer](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/left#main_menu_adjustment_and_navigation).

Reports on the activity of a unit can be presented in the form of tables and graphs. They can be viewed in a browser window, as well as [exported](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/query/export) to files of various formats.

The _Reports_ panel window can be divided into four sections:  


* in the upper left corner, the report [parameters](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/query/query) are adjusted; 
* in the lower left corner there are [report templates](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/templ/templ). After a report is generated, this section changes to the navigation bar; 
* in the upper right section, there is the [map](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/templ/settings/map) \(or [another chart or table](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/query/online?&#dual_report_view)\); 
* in the lower right section, you see the report itself \([tables](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/tables/tables), [charts](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/templ/contents/charts/charts), images\).

The sectors can be resized \(the left ones — in width, the right ones — both in width and height\). To do this, click on the border between them with the left mouse button and while holding it, move the border to the right/left or up/down. At the same time, if less than 10% of the map is left while expanding the lower sector, the map automatically collapses. To expand it, press the line under the [top panel](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/top).![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/lib/exe/indexer.php?id=user%3Areports%3Areports&1550651077)
