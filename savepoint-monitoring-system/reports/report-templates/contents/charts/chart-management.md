# Chart Management

It is possible to scale, move the charts and view the information about individual points.

Above the chart, there is a toolkit with useful buttons:

| ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/area_zoom.png)  **Area selection** | Click this button to scale \(zoom in\) any selected area. Hold left mouse button and select the required area. This operation can be repeated multiple times. |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/y_scale.png) / ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/xy_scale.png)  **Lock/unlock Y-axis** | Switching from work with a single axis \(X\) to multiple axes \(XY\). |
| ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/original_scale.png)  **Autoscaling** | Return to the original scale of the chart. |
| ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/zoomin.png) ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/zoomout.png)  **Zoom in/zoom out** | The buttons change the scale of the chart by fifty percent with respect to the visible zone. The center of the chart remains fixed. |
| ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/point_several.png) / ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/point.png)  **Messages/point tracing** | Switching between these modes makes it possible to look through the information on one chart or on all available ones by hovering the cursor. |
| ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/saver.png)  **Save as PNG** | The button allows you to save the visible area of the chart along with the coordinate axes in PNG format. |
| ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/lock.png)  **Lock charts** | This button appears in the [_Dual report view_](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/query/online?&#dual_report_view) mode. Activating this button allows to apply the same actions to the charts simultaneously. |

If the X-axis shows time, you can click any place of the chart to move to the corresponding location on the map.

_**Transfer from chart to messages**_

This function is useful for analyzing the source data from the unit. In order to request messages from the unit from the chart, click the _Transfer to messages_ button ![](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/_media/icons/messages-01.png) located on the right side of the toolbar. Click the left mouse button anywhere in the chart. As a result, you will go to the message panel with open data for the period specified in the report. Other functionality works in the same way as [transfer from tabular report to messages](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/query/online#transfer_from_tabular_report_to_messages).

When switching between charts, the state of the button automatically changes to the original one.

The rest of the buttons work the same as in the table reports.

### Chart Legend <a id="chart_legend"></a>

A chart legend can be found in the work area. The legend is divided into sections and contains information about the selected charts and their [properties](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/templ/contents/charts/properties). Click on the name of the element in the legend to enable or disable its display in the chart \(by default, all are displayed\).
