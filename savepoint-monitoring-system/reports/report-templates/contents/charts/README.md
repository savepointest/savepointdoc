# Charts

In addition to the tabular form, some information in the report can be presented in the form of a chart. For example, a chart may reflect a change in fuel level or speed at a given time interval, the parameters of sensors, etc.

To create a chart, the corresponding equipment must be installed and configured on the unit \(this does not concern charts for speed and altitude\). To create and configure sensors, see the [_Units â€“&gt; Sensors_](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/units/sensors/sensors) section.

To add a chart to the report template, click on the _New Chart_ button on the _Contents_ tab of its properties.

![:!:](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/lib/images/smileys/icon_exclaim.gif) Charts can only be added to reports of the _Unit_ and _User_ type.

In the dialog for creating a new chart, specify its name and select the type.
