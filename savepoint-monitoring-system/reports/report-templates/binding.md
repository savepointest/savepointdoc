# Binding

The report template, depending on its type, can be bound to specific elements of the system and their groups \(for units, drivers, trailers, and passengers\). Binding allows you to restrict the list of items for which the report is run.

To move the required items from the left list to the right one, double-click the required items or click the _Add_ button \(rightwards arrow\). For convenience of search it is possible to use [dynamic filter](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/gui/masks#dynamic_search) above the list. The numeric indicator in parentheses next to the name of the tab indicates the number of bound items.

Thus, when [generating a query](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/query/query) from the template, the drop-down list of items contains only those that have been bound. If the group is bound to the report template, the name of each object is displayed in the drop-down list.
