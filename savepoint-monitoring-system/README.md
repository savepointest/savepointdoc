# SavePoint Monitoring System

The monitoring system is used by end [users](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/users/users) to control their [units](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/cms/units/units) \(vehicle fleet, machinery, employees, pets, etc.\).

Unit tracking includes:

* detecting the position of units and [watching](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/monitor) their movements on the map;
* observing dynamic changes of various unit parameters such as speed, fuel level, temperature, voltage, etc.;
* management of units \(sending [commands](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/monitor/cmd) and messages, assigning [jobs](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/jobs/jobs) and [routes](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/routes/routes), adjusting [notifications](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/notify/notify), etc.\) and [drivers](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/drivers/drivers) \(phone calls, [SMS](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/tools/sms), registering work shifts, binding to unit, etc.\);
* interpreting information derived from a unit in various kinds of [reports](https://docs.wialon.com/en/hosting/user/reports/reports) \(tables, charts, movement tracks, event markers, complete statistics, etc.\);
* and much more.

Tracking results can be either presented on a computer screen or exported to files in different formats.
