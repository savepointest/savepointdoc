# SavePoint Monitoring System

The monitoring system is used by end users to control their units \(vehicle fleet, machinery, employees, pets, etc.\).

Unit tracking includes:

* detecting the position of units and watching their movements on the map;
* observing dynamic changes of various unit parameters such as speed, fuel level, temperature, voltage, etc.;
* management of units \(sending commands and messages, assigning jobs and routes, adjusting notifications, etc.\) and drivers \(phone calls, SMS, registering work shifts, binding to unit, etc.\);
* interpreting information derived from a unit in various kinds of reports \(tables, charts, movement tracks, event markers, complete statistics, etc.\);
* and much more.

Tracking results can be either presented on a computer screen or exported to files in different formats.
